  <h2>Sparrow's MOST <em>horrific plane ride</em></h2>
  <p>When Sparrow was 1 year into kittenhood, she was forcibly removed from her squatty apartment home in Ohio and endured a 8 hr(not including layover) plane ride to Oregon.</p>
  <p>despite being sedated and to the dismay of other passengers: Sparrow yowled the entire trip.</p>
  <h3>This was her most harrowing experience to date</h3>
